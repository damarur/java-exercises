# Java exercises

The idea of this project is to set up a bunch of exercises that candidates need to perform in a technical interview.

## Java

On one side, there should be exercises with only Java code, just to check what is the level of the candidate

## Spring

On the other side, we can go for more specific questions about Repositories, Services, Controllers...
